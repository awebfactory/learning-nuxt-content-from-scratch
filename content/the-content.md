## Nuxt Content

This page corresponds to the `/` route of your website. You can delete it or create another file in the `content/` directory.

Try to navigate to [/about](/about). This page is rendered by the `pages/[...slug].vue` component.

So is [Project 1](/projects/project1) and [Project 2](/projects/project2)]
